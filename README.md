Python Projects Workspace

This repository is a personal collection of Python projects, experiments and notebooks used while learning and practicing Python, data analysis, and machine learning.


This README gives quick setup and run instructions for the main runnable pieces in the workspace.

## Quick setup

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10+ recommended (some subprojects may need newer versions). If you already have the included `env/` virtual environment, you can activate it. Otherwise create a venv.

Activate the provided venv (Windows, Git Bash ):

```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```

Install dependencies per-project (recommended). From the root folder:

```bash
pip install -r CLI_app/requirements.txt
pip install -r Inventory_app/requirements.txt
pip install -r EDA/requirements.txt
```

Note: `pattern_lab/` and `MLPreg/` are done in Goolge Colab. While most code are written by me additional help from AI is taken to learn and implement how some functions.
